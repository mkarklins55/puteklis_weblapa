We are driving
past trees and road signs,
faster than time,
each on our own checkerboard square.

Black and white,
our reality show,
the goal seemingly the same –
to breathe the longest.

We sink into meadow idylls,
like buoys on a cosmic probe,
we'll bury the skeletons together
and stack memories like coins.

So let’s drive
in a four-walled horizon
towards no return.

When you laugh
even angels fall silent,
wrapped in paradise blankets,
counting joy like money.

When you cry
all demons awaken,
waiting with cups of flame
for tears like death and ruin.

But when you stand before me,
my heart rages,
it doesn’t understand –
a dream or reality.

Palm lines are my map
but still the night confuses.
And those birds, drunk again,
scream my name in chorus.

I can’t take it anymore –
those snowflake mosquitoes,
hitting me like bullets,
melting into my hair.

Smoke rises before me,
dancing souls swirling,
and I let myself drift
toward another horizon,
another smoky orbit.

Please, help me –
bring the sun to my doorstep,
for my eyes see only darkness.

Change myself,
change for the better,
be perfect like grammar,
stay silent and touch,
trace a soft line with fingers,
draw the eternal memory axis,
connect four tiny blue points,
use it like a drug daily,
wash away problems,
overdose,
walk possessed,
click "like" every day,
live like elimination games,
reach the finals.
And win
