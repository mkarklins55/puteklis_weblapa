[Verse 1]
You swept me like ashes
Through cracks in the floor
You spoke of forever
Then slammed shut the door
Each promise was brittle
Each whisper ran dry
I drifted in silence
Too broken to cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the storms are rising
Your voice turns to sand
The dust of all your betrayals
Slips through my hands

[Chorus]
I AM DUST!
Rising from your wreckage cold
I AM DUST!
Stripped of dreams you stole
I AM DUST!
Born from shattered trust
I AM DUST!
Still standing through the rust

[Verse 2]
You built me of nothing
And called it my name
A tower of splinters
Collapsing in shame
I clung to the fragments
Of things never real
A shadow, a whisper,
A wound you could steal

[Pre-Chorus]
But the air is clearing
Your chains break like clay
I'm carried by tempests
Far from your decay

[Chorus]
I AM DUST!
Rising from your wreckage cold
I AM DUST!
Stripped of dreams you stole
I AM DUST!
Born from shattered trust
I AM DUST!
Still standing through the rust

[Instrumental Break]

(Heavy, dark riff with echoes and bass drops)

[Bridge]
You built your throne of lies
In palaces of smoke
I was just the ashes
You laughed as you broke
But I’m not your ruin
I’m the storm you can't tame
The dust you thought forgotten
Now screams out your name!

[Chorus — Final]
I AM DUST!
Rising from your wreckage cold
I AM DUST!
Stripped of dreams you stole
I AM DUST!
Born from shattered trust
I AM DUST!
Still burning through the rust

[Outro]
Through every ruin
Through every flame
I carry the silence
You branded my name
I AM DUST!
I AM DUST!
