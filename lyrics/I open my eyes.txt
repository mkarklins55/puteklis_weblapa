[Verse 1]
I open my eyes,
only ashes and light.
No sky, no ground,
only a cold face.

The wind carries me further,
no direction, no goal,
only shadows in the mist,
only dust in the game.

[Chorus]
Born in dust,
lost from the light,
we fly, we fall,
no one will find us.

Born in dust,
carried by the wind,
we scream, we whisper,
our names fade away.

[Verse 2]
No house, no harbor,
only footsteps in the sand.
Forgotten dreams
burn in my hand.

I search for voices,
for warmth, for time,
but dust in my lungs
makes everything far away.

[Chorus]
Born in dust,
lost from the light,
we fly, we fall,
no one will find us.

Born in dust,
carried by the wind,
we scream, we whisper,
our names fade away.

[Bridge] (Dark ambient + slow muted trumpet or saxophone atmosphere)
Dust on the skin,
cold in the heart,
no morning, no dream,
only dust, only pain.

[Final Chorus] (quiet â†’ building up)
Born in dust,
lost from the light,
we fly, we fall,
no one will find us.

Born in dust,
carried by the wind,
we scream, we whisper,
our names fade away.

[Outro] (Soft, jazzy instrumental fading into silence)
Only dust.
Only light.
Only dust.
