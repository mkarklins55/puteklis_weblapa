🎧 "WALK, MOTHERFUCKER"
(raw electro-urban poetry with teeth)

[Intro – whispered]
Streets don’t care.
Doors don't wait.
Your god’s offline.
Get in. Shut up.

[Verse 1 – slow & filthy groove]
Tram jerks like a drunk in a back-alley fight,
steel wheezing like lungs full of shit and smoke.
Lights flicker.
Something growls.
The floor is piss-wet, and we’re in it now.

You fall.
I grin.
It’s that kind of ride.

[Chorus – shouted, distorted]
WALK, MOTHERFUCKER!
Burn your map.
Swallow your prayer.
No one's coming.
WALK, MOTHERFUCKER!
Through the glass, through the filth —
you asked for this.
Now go.

[Verse 2 – more visual, more vulgar]
Shopfront mannequins with perfect tits,
dead-eyed dwarves in catalog kitchens.
I don’t blink.
You pretend.

There's a junkie pissing on a PayPoint screen.
There's a priest crying in the frozen food aisle.
Love this city?
Suck it.
It spits you out anyhow.

[Bridge – growling, close mic]
You gave that bastard a smoke —
he looked at you like he fucked your dog.
No thank you.
No name.
Just sweat and rot.

[Verse 3 – rhythm picks up]
Stairs smell like old bleach and dead rats.
Glass breaks — not dramatic, just real.
White cats stalking like ghosts on heat.
Branches slam the window like fists in a dream.

[Final Chorus – repeat, faster, scream-layered]
WALK, MOTHERFUCKER!
No one cares.
No one’s clean.
No heaven here.
WALK, MOTHERFUCKER!
No sleep.
No light.
No turning back.
You wanted truth?
Here it is.

[Outro – spoken, cracked]
You lay down.
You close your eyes.

I light a cigarette.
And I keep fucking walking.
