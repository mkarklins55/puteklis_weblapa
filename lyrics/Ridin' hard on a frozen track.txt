[Verse 1]
Ridin' hard on a frozen track,
Boots are cracklin', ain't no turnin' back.
Sky's so cold, it cuts like steel,
Dust on the rails, that's all I feel.

[Chorus]
Dust on the rails, ghost in the smoke,
Whispers and thunder under my coat.
Out where the wild winds tear up the sky,
I'm just a shadow ridin' by.
Dust on the rails, dust in my soul,
A heart made of ice, and a dream full of holes.

[Verse 2]
Moonlight's sharp as a broken blade,
Lost my name in the deals I made.
Every town’s a flickerin' ghost,
I chase the cold and I love it most.

[Chorus]
Dust on the rails, ghost in the smoke,
Whispers and thunder under my coat.
Out where the wild winds tear up the sky,
I'm just a shadow ridin' by.
Dust on the rails, dust in my soul,
A heart made of ice, and a dream full of holes.

[Bridge]
A six-string cry and a whiskey sigh,
Frozen breath ‘neath a dead man's sky.
No home callin’, no warm embrace,
Just a bootheel kissin’ empty space.

[Chorus]
Dust on the rails, ghost in the smoke,
Whispers and thunder under my coat.
Out where the wild winds tear up the sky,
I'm just a shadow ridin' by.
Dust on the rails, dust in my soul,
A heart made of ice, and a dream full of holes.

[Bridge]
A six-string cry and a whiskey sigh,
Frozen breath ‘neath a dead man's sky.
No home callin’, no warm embrace,
Just a bootheel kissin’ empty space.


[Final Chorus]
Dust on the rails, ghost in the smoke,
Whispers and thunder under my coat.
Out where the wild winds tear up the sky,
I'm just a shadow ridin' by.
Dust on the rails, dust in my soul,
A heart made of ice, and a dream full of holes.
