🌍 The World Keeps Turning

[Verse 1]
The world keeps turning, it never stops, same every day.
Sunset in the evening, sunrise again, same old way.
People pass by me, eyes to the ground, nothing to say.
But I’ve learned to pause, to hold out a hand — not fade away.

[Chorus]
And always beside me, my past walks in step,
But today is a moment I still won’t forget.
If this is the moment, the moment that shines,
Then it’s real, and it’s mine — the one of its kind.

[Verse 2]
We’ll run through the puddles to the edge of the map — change the view.
We’ll hide in the mist like kids in a game — not déjà vu.
We’ll follow the clouds and fall in the grass — strange but true.
And I’ll call it joy, just standing with you — not feeling blue.

[Chorus]
And always beside me, my past walks in step,
But today is a moment I still won’t forget.
If this is the moment, the moment that shines,
Then it’s real, and it’s mine — the one of its kind.
