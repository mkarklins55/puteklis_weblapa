“Saint.exe (Of the Hollow)”
(Neo-Industrial Cabaret Ritual with Electro-Glam pulse)

[Verse 1 – Spoken like sermon, distorted whisper in back]

I was born
in a broken download,
baptized in glitch,
raised on control codes.

You wrote the scripture
in sans-serif shame —
I carved it back
on a latex frame.

[Pre-Chorus – chanting, voice stacked with FX]

You don’t save me —
you just brand me.
Put your icon
in my skin
and scan me.

[Chorus – beat drops, danceable, brutal glamour]

🎛️
I’m the saint dot exe —
file of belief,
cloaked in ritual,
running underneath.

Not holy,
not clean,
just viral,
and seen.

I crash when I pray —
amen in machine.

[Verse 2 – Brechtian monologue, ironic tone]

Dress me like truth.
Choke me like faith.
Hang your guilt
on my metal wraith.

I'm your blasphemy
in a disco suit.
Lip-syncing scripture
to a MIDI flute.

[Bridge – rhythmic industrial whisper]

Wires as veins,
mirrors as soul,
plug in your god —
and lose control.

[Chorus 2 – louder, layered, theatrical rise]

I’m the saint dot exe —
altar in code,
click to redeem
what you already sold.

Not chosen.
Not damned.
Just formatted
to stand.

Confess through a filter,
salvation on demand.

[Spoken Coda – slow, smoky]

Don’t touch the cross.
It’s melting.
Don’t kiss the priest.
He’s downloading.

[Final Echo – digital decay]

Holy.
Empty.
Executable.
