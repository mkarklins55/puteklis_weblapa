I’m the palm.
I call the shots.
Maybe my head’s a goddamn thumb,
maybe a finger that points and judges —
or maybe it’s
that dirty-ass middle finger
I shove up
the world’s fake smile
with a slow, sticky fuck-you.

And yeah —
I get to choose
what wraps this fist:
silk? steel?
or something worse —
a glove ripped out
from under my own ribs,
stitched from nerves,
tight with pulse,
still wet
with my goddamn blood.

A glove
that fits too fucking well.
A glove
made of me.
Of what’s left.
