The Button

Verse 1
Like a cherry clinging high on a tree,
Guarding the last sweet memory,
I wear an old shirt, threadbare and torn,
Still saving one button, weathered and worn.

Verse 2
No souvenirs left, no dreams in my sack,
When the weight of the world rides hard on my back,
I reach in my pocket, feel that old thread,
The button you sewed, still holding my head.

Chorus
Through the years and the hunger,
Through the snow and the thunder,
You stitched me tight to this broken life,
With threads of love and forever.

Verse 3
Night beats down the trembling day,
I look for a light to guide my way,
No window shines, just a burning glow,
Itâ€™s the button you sewed, shining low.

Chorus
Through the years and the hunger,
Through the snow and the thunder,
You stitched me tight to this broken life,
With threads of love and forever.

Outro
A single button, warm on my chest,
Your love, your thread, my final rest.
