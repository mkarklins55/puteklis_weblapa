ðŸŽ§ Awake to Be Happy (Fast Dirty Electro-Jazz Version â€“ 125 BPM)

(Verse 1 â€“ fast rhythm, staccato vocal)
You fucked, you ran, you left the light on,
Took my breath and kept your tights on.
The world donâ€™t spin â€” it grinds and screams,
With latex dreams and bloodshot beams.

Iâ€™m done with soft, I want it loud,
Hands on throat and screaming proud.
Love ainâ€™t silk, itâ€™s ropes and bites â€”
So donâ€™t pretend youâ€™re into lights.

(Chorus â€“ dancefloor tempo, bass pulsing)
Weâ€™re up all night to kill the shame,
To ride the bass, to wreck the name.
No sweet goodbyes, no "take it slow" â€”
Just moans and sweat and overflow.
If you bounce, then donâ€™t play nice â€”
Just spit it out and fuck me twice.

(Verse 2 â€“ more melodic, but still raw)
You whispered lies into my thighs,
Then came and left â€” no alibis.
Your hands were fast, your heart was fake,
You needed noise, not what I break.

Desireâ€™s dirt, not polished gold â€”
Itâ€™s breathless, bruised, and barely bold.
I didnâ€™t ask for love to stay â€”
Just one more round to tear away.

(Chorus â€“ heavier beat, more distorted)
Weâ€™re up all night for filthy kicks,
For nasty songs and broken dicks.
No candlelight, no clean regret â€”
Just cum and bass and soaked-up sweat.
If you leave, then leave in style â€”
Iâ€™ll dance it off and bleed awhile.

(Bridge â€“ instrumental drop + whispering chant)
Name me sin, name me skin,
Touch me where the shame begins.
Lights flash red, and pulse goes blind â€”
I lost my name to your behind.

(Final Chorus â€“ climax, screaming synths)
Weâ€™re up all night to feel the burn,
To touch, to taste, to never learn.
No savior sex, no gentle plea â€”
Just dirty rhythm set me free.
If Iâ€™m awake, Iâ€™m not alone â€”
I fucked the beat, I cracked the tone.
