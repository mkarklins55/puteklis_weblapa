When all the fucking ropes snap,
the only thing left
to save you
will be the goddamn noose.

When the owl finally shuts its dead fucking eyes,
you’ll need a match
to set fire
to your own silence.

When the lightbulb says “fuck it,”
you’ll drink with darkness
like it’s your last goddamn friend.

When everything you needed
becomes fucking useless,
you’ll swallow the impossible
and shit out despair.

When no one promises you jack shit anymore,
that’s when your next step
lands right on the fucking truth
and crushes it like a bug.

When the rock tied around your chest
becomes your lifebuoy,
it’s just because
every fucking ocean
is gone.

When your tears taste like honey,
you’ll still be surrounded
by fake-ass comforters
who smile
and leave you cold.

When the swamp starts blooming roses,
we’ll drown in that sweet-smelling shit
anyway.
