ðŸ“œ A Little Song for Joy
And if someday Iâ€™m cursed and blamed,
Beaten down and called by names,
I sit myself down, soft and plain,
And write a little song for joy again.

Chorus:
A song for me, a song for light,
A song to make my own heart right.
And from these humble lines I weave,
A little joy I can believe.

And for myself, and maybe you,
And all the weary people too,
If someone feels like singing along,
Theyâ€™re welcome to this little song.

It doesnâ€™t take so much at all,
Sometimes just a spark, so small,
To write a song for joy anew,
A song for me, a song for you.

And if somehow you feel the same,
And donâ€™t think this a foolish game,
You too can hum these lines tonight,
A little song to hold you tight.
