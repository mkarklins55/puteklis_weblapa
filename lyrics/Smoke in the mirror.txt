"No One Left to Wait For"
(in the style of “Road to Hell” / Gothic Americana)

[Intro – ritmiska ģitāra, balsī – nelokāms miers]

There's smoke in the mirror,
and blood on the screen.
You scroll past the silence,
pretend it's not seen.

They say it's not our fight,
but the price gets near.
One more mile,
one less fear.

[Verse 1 – tamburīns, bass sit ritmā ar soļiem]

He walks through a town
with no name on the sign.
Only dust knows
what used to be mine.

The school is a shelter.
The church is bare.
His God’s gone quiet,
but the drones still stare.

[Chorus – smeldzīgi, bet stingri]

🎸
This ain't no battlefield —
it's just the street we live on.
No flag made this holy.
No army sings this song.

You can call it politics.
You can turn off the screen.
But we still breathe fire
through every war machine.

[Verse 2 – ģitāra ar efektu, balsī – čuguna dūmi]

She’s cooking in candlelight,
nails black from fear.
They told her to run.
She stayed.
Now she steers.

Steers through rubble,
through ash, through noise.
Carrying nothing
but broken toys.

[Bridge – ritms paliek, bet balss sarunājas ar klausītāju]

You sent thoughts.
We sent sons.
You drew lines.
We drew guns.

You made statements.
We dug graves.
You gave speeches.
We gave names.

[Chorus 2 – skaļāks, raupjāks, niknāks]

🎸
This ain't no headline.
This is hell in slow scroll.
You sip coffee —
we lose whole souls.

You post peace.
We burn clean.
You change the channel —
we change the scene.

[Outro – ģitāra solo pāriet klusumā, balsī čuksts]

No one left to wait for.
But we still wait.
