üêÑ "Old Man and a Hundred Dreams"

Verse 1
He's a widower, bald, with a wrinkled old face,
Grumpy and growling, madder than death,
Folks would call me crazy if I took his place ‚Äî
Spit and curse, may the devil take your breath!
A herd of kids comes tagging along,
No way, no way ‚Äî I'm standing strong!

Verse 2
But those fields and those gardens, they gnaw at my mind,
And the fat cows and pigs, well-fed and fine,
Where else could I earn a loaf I could find,
Who else would clothe these poor feet of mine?
And all day long, the thought comes and goes:
What if ‚Äî what if I just say "yes," who knows?

Chorus
Oh, it's the fields, it's the cows,
It's the silver and the vows,
It's the cupboards and the sheep,
It‚Äôs the dreams I cannot keep,
It's the hunger, it's the gold,
It's the stories I've been told ‚Äî
Would I stay or would I stray,
Or sell my heart away?

Verse 3
I once swore I'd wait for a boy from the sea,
Poor, but smiling, golden curls wild and free,
And my heart aches just thinking of him,
Far across oceans, horizons dim.
Oh, how I long for his sunlit hair,
But he‚Äôs so far, and life's not fair.

Verse 4
Still I imagine, bright pots shining in a row,
Keeping that old man gentle and slow,
He won't last long ‚Äî that much I know,
I'd be a rich widow before the first snow.
What a sin, what a waste it would be,
To let all that fortune slip past me!

Chorus
Oh, it's the fields, it's the cows,
It's the silver and the vows,
It's the cupboards and the sheep,
It‚Äôs the dreams I cannot keep,
It's the hunger, it's the gold,
It's the stories I've been told ‚Äî
Would I stay or would I stray,
Or sell my heart away?

Bridge
But breaking a vow ‚Äî how that would sting,
A boy‚Äôs sweet promise ain't a casual thing.
It would gnaw at my soul, night and day,
Till even the tears would fade away.

Final Verse
Still the old man‚Äôs riches keep clouding my head,
Silver and linen, warm fires and bread,
The cows and the pigs, the barns and the fields,
A life full of plenty, if only I'd yield.
So I guess I will go, take his heavy old hand,
Even with a dozen kids and a worn-out man.

Final Chorus (louder and playful)
Oh, it's the fields, it's the cows,
It's the silver and the vows,
It's the cupboards and the sheep,
It‚Äôs the dreams I cannot keep,
It's the hunger, it's the gold,
It's the lies we all are told ‚Äî
Would I stay or would I stray,
Or just dance my life away?

Outro
Would I stay or would I stray...
Or just dance it all away?
