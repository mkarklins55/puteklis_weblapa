[Chorus]
Oh little Button, scared and small,
Running from needles, running from all.
Oh little Button, don't you see,
Sewing your place sets you free.

[Verse 1]
In a café corner, Button sat tight,
With old Matty Buckle sharing her fright.
“Watch those threads, girl, don’t you trust,
One wrong stitch and you’re sewn to dust!”

[Chorus]
Oh little Button, scared and small,
Running from needles, running from all.
Oh little Button, don't you see,
Sewing your place sets you free.

[Verse 2]
Button ran from forks and from pins,
Sneezed past a pepper with trembling grins.
Saw a tower like a giant needle rise,
Button ran ‘til tears filled her eyes.

[Chorus]
Oh little Button, scared and small,
Running from needles, running from all.
Oh little Button, don't you see,
Sewing your place sets you free.

[Bridge]
Rough old Zipper laughed and teased,
“Hey little coin, you ain’t no piece!”
No holes, no shine, no color, no glow,
Poor Button thought, “Maybe I don’t know…”

[Verse 3]
Then Needle came and took her hand,
Led her to Thread, a gentle stand.
“You’ve been free but lost and tossed,
Come here, sweet Button, no love is lost.”

[Chorus]
Oh little Button, scared and small,
Running from needles, running from all.
Oh little Button, now you see,
Sewing your heart sets you free.

[Outro]
Now Buttons dance on shirts and sleeves,
Hold the jackets and catch the breeze.
And if you look to the skies someday,
Even the stars are buttoned that way.
