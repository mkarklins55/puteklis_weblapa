Crows return on shattered wings,
broken voices, crooked springs.
Empty houses, doors ajar,
dust in the wells, ash on the stars.

Through silent fields,
through hollow skies,
we ride the ruins,
we break the lies.
Through silent fields,
through shattered days,
we chase the morning,
through broken ways.

Rust on stone, fire in clay,
shadows falling where children played.
No songs are left, but winds still call,
a dream of flight beyond the fall.

Through silent fields,
through hollow skies,
we ride the ruins,
we break the lies.
Through silent fields,
through shattered days,
we chase the morning,
through broken ways.

We chase the morning... through broken ways...
