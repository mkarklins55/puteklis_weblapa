🕶️ Awake to Be Happy (Groove Noir Version)
(Verse 1 – medium tempo, walking bass, finger snap groove)
You lit me up, then walked away,
Left lipstick smears in disarray.
The world still turns on broken vows,
On sweat, on skin, on don’t ask how.

I’ve walked too far to fake a smile,
Too sharp to sweet-talk with denial.
You want the truth? Then pour it neat —
Love ain’t polite, it’s on the street.

(Chorus – rhythmic, swaying, biting)
So raise your drink and bite your lip,
Toast to the night that’s lost its grip.
We’re up all night to feel the sting —
Not love, not hope, but that damn thing.
If you leave, babe, don’t look back —
I ride alone. I’ve learned to crack.

(Verse 2 – more swagger, sultry)
He died the way we all pretend —
Too proud to ask, too broke to bend.
I held his breath, I held the lie,
Then dressed it up and let it die.

Desire’s not soft, it claws, it crawls —
It hums in dirty bathroom stalls.
I didn’t need romance or pride,
Just proof I’m still a pulse inside.

(Chorus – groovier, almost taunting)
So speak my name like you forgot it,
Like I was jazz you once had spotted.
We’re up all night, not for salvation —
Just lips and hips and pure damnation.
If you split — then split for good,
I’m not your dream. I’m flesh and blood.

(Bridge – spoken rhythm, like late-night radio)
Grind your guilt against my spine,
Float that smoke, ignore the sign.
I’m not your saint, I’m not your ghost —
I’m what you missed when you got close.

(Final Verse – bold, hot, full swing)
This gift is torn, not tied in bows,
It stings, it lingers, no one knows.
“We’re up all night to get lucky,” right?
But lucky’s just a longer fight.

I’m still awake, in heels and flame,
Still speaking truths you tried to tame.
I’m not your past, I’m not your blame —
I’m the fire you never could name.
