"Sunday Train"

Two days rolling, wind in our face,
springtime waking, picking up pace.
First day cloudy, sky like stone,
pushing pedals, shaking bones.

Wrong train car but who could care,
bikes and elbows everywhere.
Some folks grumble, some folks grin,
we laugh and shove our wheelies in.

Rolling home on a Sunday train,
feet are sore but who's to blame?
Wind still singing in my ear,
riding stories far and near.

Pussy Willow Sunday, sun broke through,
warming up our frozen crew.
She climbed aboard with travel worn hands,
thirty years across the lands.

Rolling home on a Sunday train,
feet are sore but who's to blame?
Wind still singing in my ear,
riding stories far and near.

Velos and voices, rocking slow,
telling tales as the rivers flow.
Every mile a friend you find,
every smile a thread that binds.

Rolling home on a Sunday train,
feet are sore but who's to blame?
Wind still singing in my ear,
riding stories far and near!
