🎵 “The Old Cat Walks”
(lyrics adapted from the original tale)

[Verse 1]
Red dusk falls on his tired face,
Frozen breath, no resting place.
They gave him nothing, though he gave all,
He walks alone through winter’s wall.

[Verse 2]
The doors were shut, the eyes turned blind,
He left behind what he called mine.
No one asked, and no one knew —
Just white fur trailing through the blue.

[Chorus]
🎵 But he walks,
On broken paws and memory.
And he hums,
A song he never learned to sing.
No more hate, no more fight,
Just snow, just night.

[Verse 3]
The dogs, the stones, the laughing boys,
He bore it all without a voice.
He begged for none, he cursed no name,
And found some peace inside the flame.

[Verse 4]
He told his tale with steady purr,
The girl just listened, warm and sure.
Even kings who wear a crown
Learn to weep when they sit down.

[Chorus]
🎵 Still he walks,
With ash beneath his fur.
And he speaks,
Without a single slur.
He forgives what broke him whole,
And walks it off with soul.

[Bridge – whispered or softly sung]
No one saved him.
No one came.
But still he loved —
and never named.
And from that ruin,
the mill still turned…

[Final Chorus – softer, fading]
🎵 Yes, he walks,
Through silence deep as snow.
And he hums,
A song we’ll never know.
White fur, burned and gone —
but the wheel moves on.
