🖤 “One Last Time (Burn It Down)”
(melodic industrial / cold synth punk version)

[Verse 1 – low, snarled melody]
Wrong shoes, wrong night,
Everyone pretending it’s all right.
Smile like a mask, drink like a dare,
No one feels, but they all stare.

[Verse 2 – sharper delivery, punchier]
Eyes like bruises, breath like smoke,
We came for noise, not your joke.
Plastic chairs, sticky floor,
Everyone sweating out the war.

[Chorus – soaring, but full of venom]
🎵 One last time — before we burn it down,
All the fake small talk, this dead-ass town.
One last time — no grace, no gold,
Just heat, just rhythm, just losing control.

[Verse 3 – spoken-sung, sarcastic]
The art scene coughs like it’s got the plague,
Phones scream, no one’s really awake.
We chose the bar with the broken fan,
Where you’re judged less by who you am.

[Verse 4 – heavy, bitter drive]
Some guy fell — no one moved,
We just nodded. That’s the mood.
Someone laughed at girls too young —
You call that funny? I call it done.

[Chorus – louder, fists clenched]
🎵 One last time — in this room of shame,
We dance through smoke, forget our name.
One last time — it’s all decay,
And we love it that way.

[Bridge – monotone, robotic with grit]
We came here to feel nothing.
And we got what we paid for.
But something moved in that goddamn bass.
And we didn’t blink.
We burned with it.

[Final Verse – dragging slow, exhausted and hard]
The song repeats, no one cares,
A hundred boots on plastic stairs.
We said we’d leave, we never do —
But next time,
we’re not bringing you.
