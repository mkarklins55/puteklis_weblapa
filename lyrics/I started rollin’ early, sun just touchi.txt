🎙️ “A Hundred Kilometres”
(in the style of Johnny Cash)

[Verse 1]
I started rollin’ early, sun just touchin’ pine,
The road was made of silence, and the silence felt just fine.
I heard the rubber grumble, I felt the gravel bite,
But I kept on movin’ forward — left, then right, then right.

[Verse 2]
There was sand beneath my pedals, dust inside my lungs,
The road ahead was hungry, like a mouth without a tongue.
I passed a hill that called me — a dune I didn’t climb,
‘Cause the belly clock was tickin’, and I knew I’d run outta time.

[Chorus]
🎵 Ride on, ride on, no time to wait or pray,
The road keeps talkin’ anyway.
No gold, no flag, no finish line —
Just a hundred klicks and a clear old mind.
Ride on, ride on — no lookin’ back today.

[Verse 3]
The gravel turned to concrete, then broke apart again,
I cursed a stretch so bad it nearly rattled loose my brain.
But up ahead was sweetness, the signs of man’s good grace —
A bench, a tree, a table, and a warm familiar place.

[Verse 4]
Now some folks sat and bragged a bit, with schnitzel on their plates,
But we just grabbed our soup and left before it got too late.
The road don’t wait for heroes, the sun don’t stop to rest,
And friends who ride beside you — well, they’re always ridin’ best.

[Chorus]
🎵 Ride on, ride on, the wind is at your heel,
The wheel don’t lie, and the pain is real.
No medals, no crowds, just the rattle and the beat,
Of a hundred klicks and the heat on the seat.
Ride on, ride on — just keep them pedals steel.

[Bridge – spoken like Cash might do it live:]
I’ve seen hills made out of stones,
Roads carved for tanks, not bones.
I’ve seen cars fly past too close,
And trees that whisper like ghosts.
But I keep rollin’.
I keep goin’.
And I don’t stop ‘til I smell hot food blowin’.

[Final Verse]
At last, the road grew softer, wind pushin’ from behind,
And up ahead — salvation: a place to ease the mind.
No soup stand now, but somethin’ better —
A place called “Home” with food and laughter.

[Final Chorus – low and calm:]
🎵 Ride on, ride on, through the ache and the dust,
Through the cussin’ and trust, through the rust and the must.
I came for the road, but I stayed for the crew,
And I’d ride it again... hell yes, wouldn’t you?
