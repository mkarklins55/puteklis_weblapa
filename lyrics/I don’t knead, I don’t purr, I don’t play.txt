🐾🔥 “I’m the Fuckin’ Cat”
(Dirty outlaw country / dark cabaret / death-glam Americana)

(Verse 1)
I don’t knead, I don’t purr, I don’t play with string —
I slide in boots, I own the king.
You beg for luck, I fuck the odds,
Then light a smoke and piss on gods.

Your daddy’s grave? A plot device.
You cry, I grin — ain’t that nice?
You want a future? I’ll draft it fast —
Ink it in blood and ride your ass.

(Chorus)
I’m the fuckin’ cat — not some pet,
I don’t do cute, I don’t regret.
I lie in verse, I steal in prose,
I wear your fate like tailored clothes.
So button up, kid — you’re in my play,
And I eat loyalty the savage way.

(Verse 2)
I gaslight ogres, seduce the law,
I make a fool believe in awe.
Sold your name for a crown and a slut,
Now you toast to me while I cut your cut.

I eat birds raw, I don’t say grace,
I mark my wins on your soft face.
They call it genius — I call it sport,
While you play prince in a plastic court.

(Chorus)
I’m the fuckin’ cat — claws and class,
I don’t chase dreams, I fuck 'em fast.
You think you’re chosen? Think again,
You're just my myth — I hold the pen.
Your princess? Mine. Your soul? On lease.
I smile like death — and speak like peace.

(Bridge – snarled slow)
I’ve fucked up saints and crowned the freaks,
Turned beggars into boutique chic.
I sell your shame with velvet pride —
And leave my prints where kings have died.

(Final Chorus – low, slow, then exploding)
I’m the fuckin’ cat — boots on tight,
I walk through fire and come out white.
You pray to truth — I fuck the lie,
And watch you thank me as you die.

(Outro – hissed)
Don’t pet me.
Don’t thank me.
Don’t trust me.
Just follow.
