After the autumn sadness
comes the winter apathy.
Then follows the spring fatigue,
and summer brings the fear —
the fear it might be cold,
it might be rainy,
it might be short.
Our already too short summer.

Because after summer comes the autumn sadness,
the winter apathy, the spring fatigue,
and the fear of the short, cold, rainy summer
that will be followed by
the autumn sadness,
the winter apathy,
the spring fatigue,
and the fear of another too short,
too cold, too rainy summer,
which will again be followed
by the autumn sadness,
the winter apathy,
the spring fatigue,
and the fear of a summer —
so brief, so grey, so wet...

And one day
you’ll feel the weight
of all those endless seasons —
you'll realize
you've spent your whole life
in autumn sadness,
in winter apathy,
in spring fatigue,
and in fear
of a summer
that never truly came.

And now —
now you'd like to live
as freely as a lark,
but instead,
you’re filled with sorrow,
and so very little time remains
before you no longer need to feel
the autumn sadness,
the winter apathy,
the spring fatigue,
nor the fear of another
cold and rainy
summer.
