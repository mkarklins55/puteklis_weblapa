Someday again, the paths shall cross,
But where and when remains unknown.
Though fate stands cold with heavy cost,
Each soul is kept in worlds alone.

Perhaps beside a nameless street,
Where signs have changed a hundred times.
Or near a bench where lovers meet,
By lions watching through the pines.

Like western winds along the shore,
A life once caught behind the dunes.
Beneath the pines where heather pours,
An old lullaby hums through the runes.

When in the airfield — smiling face,
Ten summers blooming in the hand.
No eye could judge what holds more grace —
The morning dew or tears unplanned.

Later through the streets shall walk,
Two shadows trailing ancient years.
While sunlight crowns the spires in gold,
Love shall live beyond all fears.

Like western winds along the shore,
A life once caught behind the dunes.
Beneath the pines where heather pours,
An old lullaby hums through the runes.

Someday again, the paths shall cross,
But where and when remains unknown.
Though fate stands cold with heavy cost,
Each soul is kept in worlds alone.

While sunlight crowns the spires in gold,
Love shall live and not grow old.
While sunlight crowns the spires in gold,
Love shall live and not grow old.
