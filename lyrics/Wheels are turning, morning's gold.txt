[Verse 1]
Wheels are turning, morning's gold,
Fields are shining, stories told.
Sun on my back, breeze in my hair,
Riding these roads without a care.

[Chorus]
Country wheels, roll me home,
Down these trails where the wild things roam.
Open skies and rivers wide,
Country wheels, take me for a ride.

[Verse 2]
Gravel flying under my boots,
Songs of the meadow, old oak roots.
Miles to go but the heart's so light,
Pedaling dreams into the night.

[Chorus]
Country wheels, roll me home,
Down these trails where the wild things roam.
Open skies and rivers wide,
Country wheels, take me for a ride.

[Bridge]
Laughing with the breeze, singing with the pines,
Every hill we climb feels like crossing lines.
No hurry, no plan, just the road and me,
And the world rolling by so easy and free.

[Final Chorus]
Country wheels, roll me home,
Past the fields where the deer have roamed.
Open skies and rivers wide,
Country wheels, take me for a ride.
Take me for a ride...
