“Ash and Velvet” (guitar version)
[Intro – tīra, reverbēta ģitāra (clean tremolo pick)
(atmosfērisks e-moll)

[Verse 1 – minimāla ģitāra ar delay]
She stitched my name in a coat of smoke,
Said: “Wear this silence, don’t provoke.”
The sky was soft, the ground stood still —
But in the dark, someone said: “Kill.”

[Verse 2 – ieviešas akordi ar gain / low crunch]
The soup was warm, the hands were white,
They raised a flag in dead of night.
I kissed her lips, I bowed and bled —
She gave me gold, then left me dead.

[Pre-Chorus – ģitāras disonējošs “scrape” vai augšējo stīgu staccato]
The pigs sang hymns in wire halls,
Blood like glass ran down the walls.
The saints wore boots, the graves were neat —
They danced on ash with frozen feet.

[Chorus – plūstoši power chords, distortion pieaug]
🎵
So dance in velvet, burn in frost,
Call it peace — but feel what’s lost.
Your little coat won’t save your skin,
The truth breaks through, it always wins.
🎵
(Palm-mute lead-out: e – g – f# – b)
Low fire… high sound…
We drift. We burn. We drown.

[Bridge – ģitāra kļūst agresīvāka, fuzz solo vai noise wall]
The soup is cold. The pigs are gone.
I wear the coat. I hum the song.
And when the sky begins to scream —
I’ll know I’m never waking clean.

[Final Chorus – pilns distortion + oktāvu melodija virsū]
🎵
So dance in shadows, dressed in flame,
Kiss the fire, forget your name.
Your little coat still reeks of fear —
But I can feel the end is near.
Low fire… high sound…
We rise.
We burn.
Unbound.
