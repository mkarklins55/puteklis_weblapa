🎤 AND THEN THEY SCREAM
(a black mass for the deaf and willing)

first row freaks
know the song
from the first electric slash of guitar
they jerk like puppets
twitching on cue
AND THEN THEY SCREAM

the second wave
they catch the first verse
like venom in a hymn
their lips move like prayers
but their eyes are already gone
AND THEN THEY SCREAM

third-row zombies
don’t notice a thing
until the fourth damn chorus
smashes through their skulls
and wakes the rot
AND THEN THEY SCREAM

the last ones
the blind ones
drenched in noise and sick in the head
they puke up static in the corner
til security drags their dead weight
from the womb of the sound
AND THEN THEY SCREAM
