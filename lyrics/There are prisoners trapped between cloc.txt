There are prisoners trapped between clock hands
whose lives slip forward unseen,
every minute chained to a second,
living under the dictatorship of time.

But there are also partisans of the life path,
for whom loss is pure motivation.
Their lives can't be touched –
they are all free and independent,
each one their own guide.

Yet still — if you feel free
but bound,
you are one of us (the morning hunters),
for our weapons are smiles,
and with them, we will open new borders.

And when the time is right,
we will change the world.
