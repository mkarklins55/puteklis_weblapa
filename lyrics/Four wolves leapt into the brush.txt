🩸 "Four Wolves" (ritual darkwave chant)
Verse 1
Four wolves leapt into the brush,
Scared the hares in deadly rush.
Two wolves dragged a girl away
Through last year’s clover grey.

Chorus (ritual)
Uijā uijā, wicked wolves
Uijā uijā...

Verse 2
Four wolves danced their crooked round
Near the haystack’s golden mound.
On its tip — a trembling cheer:
Girls were laughing, bright and clear.

Chorus (layered)
Uijā uijā, wicked wolves
Uijā uijā...

Verse 3 (slow + moan)
Wolf was wed in leafy haze,
Springlight trembled through the phase.
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooh...

Verse 4 (tense, cinematic)
Four wolves hunt, the chase is near,
Bear is waiting — edge unclear.
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooh...

Final Chorus (ghost chant)
Uijā uijā, wicked wolves
Uijā uijā...
