Out by the edge of the pinewood trail,
Where the church bell cracked and the stars turned pale,
She walks in black, with a rabbit so white,
Don’t look too long — you’ll lose your sight.

That girl with the rabbit, don't ask her name,
She don’t play cards, she don’t play games.
She just hums old hymns from a time long gone,
And the rabbit listens like he knows what’s wrong.

They say her house burned down in spring,
She never cried, just carved a ring
Of stones around the garden's edge,
Where no birds sing, and weeds don’t hedge.

That girl with the rabbit, don’t cross her path,
She’s sweet like honey, sharp like wrath.
She walks like a ghost, talks like a bell,
And that rabbit's eyes are gates to hell.

Some say she’s cursed, some say she prays,
Some say she’s waiting for Judgement Day.
But I just nod when I pass her by —
Tip my hat, and avert my eye.

So if you see her in the woods one dawn…
Just keep on drivin’. She’s long gone.
