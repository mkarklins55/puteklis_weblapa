[Verse 1]
Tires hum on a dusty lane,
Golden fields and a summer rain.
Jašs laughs as he breaks the lead,
Aivars hums a tune to the wind and the trees.

[Chorus]
Rolling through the fields,
Rolling free and wild,
Latvia stretches far and wide,
With friends at every mile.
Rolling through the fields,
Underneath the endless skies,
We'll find a home in Kurzemes night,
And dream with open eyes.

[Verse 2]
Ingūna smiles at the waving rye,
Sigita rides with a sparkle in her eye.
Uvis shouts, “Let’s chase the sun!”
The hills roll soft, the day’s not done.

[Chorus]
Rolling through the fields,
Rolling free and wild,
Latvia stretches far and wide,
With friends at every mile.
Rolling through the fields,
Underneath the endless skies,
We'll find a home in Kurzemes night,
And dream with open eyes.

[Bridge]
Old pine woods whisper our names,
Rivers gleam like silver flames.
We trade the city’s restless sound,
For stars that dance without a bound.

[Final Chorus]
Rolling through the fields,
Rolling free and wild,
Latvia stretches far and wide,
With friends at every mile.
Rolling through the fields,
Underneath the endless skies,
At Kurzemes fire, we'll rest tonight,
And ride with morning light.
