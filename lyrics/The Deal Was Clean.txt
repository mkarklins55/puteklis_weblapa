"The Deal Was Clean"
(dark Americana / outlaw folk rock / spoken blues)

[Verse 1]
He said:
“You started it.”
Like a bomb hears begging.
Like a mother
calls for war
while pulling her child
from glass.

We don’t sell shields to the loud.
We don’t hand safety
to the wrong side of brave.
We’re busy keeping the fucking balance
between golf and genocide.

[Chorus – lēni, svilinoši]
🎸
The deal was clean.
The blood was dry.
The paperwork
was signed just right.
We shook their hands,
we kissed the air,
then left the truth
to rot in prayer.

[Verse 2 – mierīgs, bet asiņains ritms]
They brought a man with no flag.
No skill.
No soul.
Just a suit
and a stupid grin.

He called it peace.
We called it cheap.
He called it business.
We called him weak.

[Bridge – zemā, čukstošā balsī]
He made no demands.
He asked no why.
He listened five hours
to the man
who lit the sky.

Then he smiled,
called it
"constructive."
God fucking help us.

[Chorus 2 – mazliet skaļāk, bet velkoši]
🎸
The deal was clean.
No facts, no flame.
We buried the names
to protect the game.
No rage.
Just range.
No stance.
Just change.

[Verse 3 – ironija aug]
Someone asked
about the sirens.
He said
it’s not productive.

Someone spoke
about the dead.
He said
it’s not constructive.

Someone screamed.
No cameras.

[Outro – tukši, izsmejot, bet melni]
We gave them
nothing.
And we called it
neutral.

The deal was clean.
The blood was not.
