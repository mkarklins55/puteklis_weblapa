Whispers fall,
shadows crawl,
dust in the veins...
we breathe it all.

Streetlight flickers in a silver mist,
Cracked sidewalks kiss my empty fists.
Dripping clocks, melting dreams,
I walk the edges of forgotten streams.

In every crack,
in every line,
Dust writes its name —
in skin, in spine.

Dust in the veins,
Smoke in the mind,
Cities are breathing,
We fall behind.
Dust in the veins,
Rust in the rain,
We’re just the echoes
of an old refrain.

Mirrors lie in the neon glow,
Footsteps blur where the cold winds blow.
Broken laughter bleeds through walls,
Dust rises silent, then slowly falls.

In every sigh,
in every frame,
Dust paints the silence
with nameless blame.


Dust in the veins,
Smoke in the mind,
Cities are breathing,
We fall behind.
Dust in the veins,
Rust in the rain,
We’re just the echoes
of an old refrain.

We drift through broken beats,
shadows chewing at our feet,
Breathless lights, forgotten signs,
whispering dust through tangled lines...


Dust in the veins,
Dust in the veins...
Falling,
Calling,
Dust in the veins...
