🎵 "Four Days in Paris"
(and all I got was this postcard and a cold)

[Verse 1]
Had a little money from the cow we sold,
told my man — I’m going bold.
“This fall or never,” I said with pride,
he laughed, “Take Valya for the ride.”

[Verse 2]
We peeled the spuds and packed our dreams,
boarded that bus with tourist schemes.
Through Poland’s fog and toilet lines,
I told Valya, “Paris will be fine.”

[Chorus]
But four days in Paris left my boots wet and grey,
they showed us glass and signs in the rain.
I’d pictured music and wine on the Seine,
but all I got was a headache and chain stores again.

[Verse 3]
The guide walked fast, we limped behind,
Valya cursed, I lost my mind.
Looked back once, felt something snap,
tears rolled down, no time to unpack.

[Chorus]
Four days in Paris — not a beret in sight,
just overpriced coffee and neon light.
No red roses or Moulin Rouge flame,
just aching feet and tourist shame.

[Bridge – spoken or softly sung]
The old man laughed when I came back home,
“You should’ve fixed your teeth, stayed close to the stove.”
He said, “Did you toss a rose from the bridge,
like that movie where the count meets his witch?”

[Final Verse]
No rose, no count, no kiss on the shore,
just soggy socks and a duty-free store.
But I still smile, 'cause I dared to go—
Paris was shit, but now I know.
