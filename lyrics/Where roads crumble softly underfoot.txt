Where roads crumble softly underfoot,
where the wind still brushes dream’s edge,
there in my blood flows restlessness,
slow and quiet like mist over fields.

Who has not fallen, has never breathed,
who has not been lost, has never walked.
The scent of earth erases footsteps,
and the night whispers to the silence.

Whatever it is —
we stand silent against it.
Whatever it is —
we stand silent against it.
Restlessness flickers like a candle in the chest,
and shadows dance between our dreams.

Old walls are fading with the rain,
the handwriting of dreams blurs away.
From a single step to the last breath drawn —
we carry our restlessness.

If peace is ice,
I will be life.
If silence is a wall,
I will be the wind.

Whatever it is —
we stand silent against it.
Whatever it is —
we stand silent against it.
Restlessness flickers like a candle in the chest,
and shadows dance between our dreams.
