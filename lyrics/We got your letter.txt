 Song title: “If Someone Licks the Stamp”
(Sexualized Swamp Blues / Dystopian Noir Ballad)

[Verse 1 – half-spoken, half-sighed]

We got your letter.
Yeah. That’s confirmed.
But we can’t promise… anything.
Not right now.
The situation is…
complicated.
But hey —
we’re still hoping for a solution.

[Verse 2 – deep croon with a crooked smile]

Still — we feel obliged to add:
your attitude,
well — forgive me —
doesn’t really help the collaboration.

You’ve been making those kinds of demands…
Instead, you could have been
so kind,
so gentle...
so... supportive.

[Chorus – smoky with slow groove]

(We’re just people too…)
Working.
Hungry.
Unwashed.
Undefeated.
Send us a keg of beer…
or a couple of meatballs.
Or anything fit for barter.
We’re not picky.

[Verse 3 – drawled blues, with twitchy silence in between]

We don’t ask for much —
a liter of blood would do.
Maybe a peace-time piece of furniture.
Preferably…
wooden.
Something to lean on.
Something with a story.

[Bridge – whispered like a late-night confession]

Support should go both ways.
Should be mutual.
And understanding.
Not just…
pressure.

[Outro – slowly fading like a gospel prayer on a burned-out stage]

When there’s news…
we’ll try to let you know.
Sadly,
we won’t be able to call.
But we will send a letter.

...If there’s still someone left...
to lick the stamp.
