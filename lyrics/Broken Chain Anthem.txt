"Broken Chain Anthem"
(grunge/post-punk grants ceļa dziesma)

Verse 1
(sadragāts ritms, skarbs tonis)

Chain snaps — don't care,
Tires bleed on dirty air.
Sun's a blade on my back,
Cracked road, no map, no track.

Chorus
(atsperīgs, ar sažņaugtu balsi)

Crawl, ride, fall again,
Dust in the gut, rocks in the brain.
Crawl, ride, break again,
Gravel gods, shout my name.

Verse 2
(spēka pazušana + spīts)

Crushed hands on the handlebars,
Missed the train, kissed the scars.
No finish line, just grit and spit,
Chewing gravel, breaking it.

Chorus (repeat)

Crawl, ride, fall again,
Dust in the gut, rocks in the brain.
Crawl, ride, break again,
Gravel gods, shout my name.

Bridge
(ļoti zemā balsī, lēnām kā murminot)

Tires scream.
Knees bleed.
Dirt sings.
I stay.

Final Chorus
(visātrāk, bez žēlastības)

Crawl, ride, fall again,
Dust in the gut, rocks in the brain.
Crawl, ride, break again,
I ride the ruin. I ride the pain.
