We don’t fight wars —
we write fucking frameworks.
We don’t invent shit —
we evaluate risks.
We don’t move —
we hold press conferences
about why movement is problematic.

We’re clean!
We’re correct!
We’re socially fucking sterile!
And when the bombs fall,
we’ll host a panel
on inclusive rubble management.

Holy shit, we look great!
Woke as fuck, broke as fuck!
Printing ethics while the planet burns —
but hey! Our gender forms are up-to-date.

China builds shit.
America breaks shit.
We hold roundtables
about whether violence
hurts people emotionally.

We whisper in 12 official languages
while tyrants scream in tanks.

Ukraine bled.
We sent statements.
Russia built missiles —
we built “strong concern”.

Holy shit, we look great!
Liberal, fragile, beautifully late!
No balls, no teeth, but shiny intentions —
goddamn, give us a fucking medal!

You scared to speak?
Good. That’s Europe.
Speak wrong — you're cancelled.
Speak right — you’re ignored.

So you just smile
and tweet flowers
while freedoms fucking choke.

Holy shit, we look great.
They’ll write eulogies
on recycled paper,
and bury us
with a fucking hashtag.

Clean hands.
Empty hands.
Cold hands.

But holy shit...
we looked
fucking
great.
