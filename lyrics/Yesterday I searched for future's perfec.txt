Yesterday I searched for future's perfection
but wandered into the wrong movie,
where getting lost in the dark
and shattering young souls
was the only plot.

Their lost gazes haunted me,
as if I had arrived from tomorrow,
and with broken words
they hammered the sharpest nails into the evening wall.

While chaotically seeking an exit,
I was caught by the sorrows of others,
their pain stung like snakebites,
their venom sucked out with the elixir of forgetting.

The fragile pace of evening dissolved at once,
and I spun apart with puzzle pieces.
Later, I woke among happiness killers,
realizing I had become one of them.

But I stood up alone,
my morning stands as witness.
