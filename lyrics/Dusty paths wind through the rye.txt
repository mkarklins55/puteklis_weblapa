[Verse 1]
Dusty paths wind through the rye,
Old fences lean as years drift by.
Broken porches, hollowed doors,
Whisper tales of lives before.

[Chorus]
Forgotten roads, lost and slow,
Where memories fade and grasses grow.
Shadows stretch where laughter died,
I ride these roads with ghosts beside.

[Verse 2]
Crumbling chimneys point to skies,
Windows stare with empty eyes.
Once there were fires, once there was song,
Now only wind hums all night long.

[Chorus]
Forgotten roads, lost and slow,
Where memories fade and grasses grow.
Shadows stretch where laughter died,
I ride these roads with ghosts beside.

[Bridge]
Fields reclaim what time has tossed,
Dreams grow quiet, never lost.
In every stone, in every tree,
The past still hums its melody.

[Final Chorus]
Forgotten roads, lost and slow,
Where memories fade and grasses grow.
I'll ride these roads till the morning light,
With ghosts to keep me warm tonight.
