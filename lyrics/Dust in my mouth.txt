Verse 1
Dust in my mouth,
Road in my eyes,
Cold wind screaming,
Under dead grey skies.

Chorus
Run through the dust,
Fall through the stones,
Latvian fields,
Dust and bones.

Verse 2
Barn doors broken,
Crows overhead,
Rust in the fences,
Dreams long dead.

Chorus
Run through the dust,
Fall through the stones,
Latvian fields,
Dust and bones.

Bridge
No way back,
No way home,
Just my heart,
Just these roads.

Final Chorus (shouted)
Run through the dust,
Fall through the stones,
Latvian fields,
Dust and bones.

Outro (chanting)
Dust and bones,
Dust and bones!
