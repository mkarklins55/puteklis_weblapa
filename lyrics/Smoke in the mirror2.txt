Smoke in the mirror,
blood on the glass.
Scroll past the silence,
pretend it won’t last.

Town with no sign.
Dust where we stood.
No side is clean.
No war is good.

Not your fight?
Still costs lives.
No one wins,
but someone drives.

We burn slow,
we breathe grit.
The road goes on —
no end to it.

Boots on the gravel,
eyes on the sky.
Kids count sirens,
learn not to cry.

School with no windows,
kitchen with flame.
Same old terror,
different name.

You post peace.
We dig in.
You drink wine.
We lose kin.

You say words.
We lose ground.
You sit safe.
We hear sound.

Not your war?
Still leaves scars.
You sleep fine.
We watch stars.

Names go missing.
Towns burn slow.
No one left —
just time to go.

One more turn.
One more day.
We drive on.
We don’t pray.
