“Sanctus Algorithmus”

Sanctus, sanctus, Sanctus Algorithmus
Veritas deletus, persona mutus.

“Your authenticity has violated community expectations.”

I confessed too early.
I loved too loudly.
I posted unfiltered thoughts
past midnight.
That was a breach
of the Terms of Feeling.

 "Strike one."

Sanctus vir / tweeted wrong.
Gloria tibi / now you're gone.
In excelsis / error code.
Agnus Dei / overload.

You never screamed.
You just logged off.
You blocked.
Reported.
Moved on.

You lit no fires.
You whispered "harm."
And drowned me
with kindness.

“This decision was made collectively.
Your tone was misaligned with the present moment.”

Sanctus, sanctus, canceled clean.
Blessed are the brands unseen.
Dies irae, like and mute.
We forgive — but don’t compute.

You say I was wrong —
but you loved me when I bled.
You followed me for the fire
and sold me for silence.

You posted my smile.
Then posted your guilt.
Then posted…
“Thoughts and prayers.”

 "Strike two."

Credo in mute gods.
Et cancelavi omnia.
Pacem meam do vobis.
In retweet, amen.

Bless me, Algorithm,
for I have lived.

I was real.
I was loud.
I was flawed.
And I was not approved.
