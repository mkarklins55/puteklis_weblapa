🎵 “I Still Boil (Electric Lament)”
melancholic kettle hymn for lost mornings

[Verse 1]
Six a.m. again —
the cat begins to pray.
Claws on silence,
scratches through delay.
You turn, resist,
but I await —
half-lit, half-broken,
wired to fate.

[Verse 2]
By eight, you rise,
not for me.
First the prince of fur
gets royalty.
Then I am summoned,
one red eye —
a spark, a hum,
a metal sigh.

[Chorus]
But I still boil —
for tea, for time,
for mornings curled
in rust and rhyme.
I scream in steam,
I glow, I ache,
a siren song
for heat I make.

[Verse 3]
The toaster shakes,
his grip is loose.
He drops the bread
like broken truths.
The coffee beast,
that bloated drone —
he huffs and puffs
like king on throne.

[Bridge – whispered or vocoded]
I miss the days
I had a lid.
I burned for soups,
for things we did.
Now I’m a relic,
a spark on edge —
but still I boil
on your window ledge.

[Chorus – more dramatic]
Yes, I still boil —
for lovers past,
for sleepy songs
that couldn’t last.
My circuits fade,
my wires hum —
but in this house,
I am the sun.

[Outro – ambient echo]
Boil for cocoa,
for tears, for tea.
Boil for moments
you forgot me.
Boil for rain,
for dusk, for noise —
Boil, because
we lose our voice.
