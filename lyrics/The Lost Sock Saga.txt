[Verse]
There's a sock that's gone astray
Vanished at the break of day
One was black the other blue
Now I'm left with just one shoe

[Chorus]
Where do the lost socks go
In a world I'll never know
Do they party do they play
In some secret hideaway

[Verse 2]
Was it eaten by the dryer
Or abducted by a liar
Is it dancing on the breeze
Or hitchhiking overseas

[Chorus]
Where do the lost socks go
In a world I'll never know
Do they party do they play
In some secret hideaway

[Bridge]
Are they building forts of lint
Leaving clues with every hint
A rebellion in disguise
Socks united they will rise

[Chorus]
Where do the lost socks go
In a world I'll never know
Do they party do they play
In some secret hideaway
