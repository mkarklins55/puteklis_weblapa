I should sort through my papers,
But they nest like ghosts in the night —
Receipts in my jacket,
Old wounds in plain sight.
There’s a bill on the windowsill,
A protocol on the chair.
A disc with my guts on it,
And dust in the air.

I once had a folder,
Just one, nearly bare.
Now I’m drowning in excerpts
And hospital air.
There’s a clerk somewhere waiting,
She’ll ask with a grin:
“Do you have that one paper?”
And I’ll nod — then give in.

That damn disc,
Still sittin’ on my desk.
Full of scans and static,
And my own abstract mess.
I ain’t called the number
On that train ticket back —
Guess it’s easier to forget
Than admit what I lack.

The doctor was staring
Like I’d killed her pet.
Said I’m wasting her minutes —
The worst kind of debt.
Told me go see the other,
And bring proof I exist.
Said my scans are in “the system” —
She just laughed and dismissed.

There’s a protocol from ‘09
Says I captained a boat
With no license, no rudder,
Just beer cans and hope.
The cops lost the plot,
The pram got delayed —
They filed me as static
And quietly waved.

That damn disc,
Still glows like a moon.
Full of inner-space Jackson Pollocks
And digital runes.
I got no idea
What it all really means —
But it’s mine, it’s me —
In electric black and green.

So I shoved all the papers
In plastic regret,
Closed the drawer softly —
And lit my cigarette.
I ain’t sorted, I ain’t fixed,
I just pushed it aside.
That disc still stares at me,
Like something I can't hide.
