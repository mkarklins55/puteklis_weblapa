🎵 “Sidewalk of Shards”
(outlaw country noir / desert blues ballad)

[Verse 1]
Shiny shards in sidewalk seams,
white-hot noon, a street of dreams.
A barefoot soul runs through the park,
meets the glass — the cut is sharp.

[Verse 2]
In the asphalt, things remain,
pressed by kids like sidewalk names.
Bottle caps and broken lore,
glass thrown hard through midnight’s door.

[Chorus]
This is the road we walk on slow,
where broken things still try to grow.
Cafés steam, the flowers scream,
and silence cuts through every dream.

[Verse 3]
Old fence creaks with ghostly tunes,
mosquitoes hum beneath pale moons.
Coffee boils, the dusk turns red,
and children chase the light ahead.

[Bridge – spoken or sung softly]
They learned to gather shards by hand,
to shoot at gods that never land.
To press against a tree and pray —
never walk a straight walkway.

[Final Verse]
The gravel sings, the tar still steams,
the petals grow from oil streams.
And as I go where roads collapse,
the glass still whispers through the cracks.
