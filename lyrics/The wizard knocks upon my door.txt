The wizard knocks upon my door,
And asks me, “Would you like to go?”
To hide with him in fields so still,
And watch the snails move slow.
The ants are building something grand,
The crickets play a song.
The moon up high pulls crooked wheels,
Toward the day beyond.

The wizard knocks on your front step,
And asks you, “Would you like to run?”
To catch the sky before it breaks,
And chase the falling sun.
The sand slips softly through your hands,
Like time you couldn’t keep.
The roses bloom, though cast aside —
For love they learn to weep.

So come with me, come if you hear —
The knocking on your gate.
The wizard waits where grasses hum,
Let’s not be late.
The stars are out, the night is young,
And something calls us near...
To watch the world in wonder move,
When hearts are clear.

The wizard knocks on our front door,
And whispers, “Would you like to stray?”
To vanish in the hush of fields,
And drift the dusk away.
The ants are raising halls of light,
The crickets never lie.
The moon is hauling dreams tonight,
Across a restless sky.

So come with me, come if you will,
Let’s walk without regret.
The wizard’s road is soft and still,
And not quite mapped out yet.
The night will hold our foolish steps,
The stars won't let us fall —
And maybe, in that quiet field,
We’ll hear it all.
