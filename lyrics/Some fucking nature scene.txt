Verse 1
Some fucking nature scene.
A view — who the hell knows.
A bush? A goddamn cloud?
Like it fucking matters.

Verse 2
Should I go, or stay the fuck home?
Life’s usual bullshit twists.
Tiny dramas in a big dumb play.
Like it fucking matters.

Verse 3
Some half-baked conclusion.
Losing your mind or giving in.
Call it peace, or just giving up.
Like it fucking matters.
