He loved the burn,
the swirling gin,
his head would spin —
and he’d let it win.

Round and round,
till the sky went black.
Stop. Reverse.
Then fall right back.

He walked like a hymn
with legs of foam,
the world too straight
to call it home.

And when they said,
“Your head will drop,”
he smiled and drank —
said, “We’ll both go pop.”

Oh, the man with the turning head,
mouth in back, and dreams half-dead.
Spoons can’t reach where lips have fled —
so his children fed him bread.

His boats turned sideways,
his cows broke loose,
his song was slurred,
his grip too loose.

Laid off from work,
he found his role —
a scarecrow saint
with a tin can soul.

Bundled in bells,
he spun in fields,
till even crows
could feel his shields.

But one spring day
when balloons were bold,
his lilac nose
got tired of mold.

It saw the sky —
its violet kin,
and drifted off
with a plastic grin.

Oh, the man with the drifting breath,
he died alone in spinning death.
They say his nose was all he left —
and inked the world
with lilac theft.

Now they wear muzzles
for fear of flight.
Hold their noses
in sleep at night.

If you see one
painted plum —
don’t ask why.
Just don’t run.
