🐄 "Dust and Silver"

Verse 1
Old man’s bald, mean as a crow,
Wrinkled face, twelve kids in tow,
Folks call me crazy if I say yes,
Spit and curse — Lord, what a mess!

Chorus
But the fields are wide,
And the cows are fat,
The kitchen shines,
And the money stacks.
Dreams don’t buy no shoes or bread —
Maybe better rich than dead.

Verse 2
I swore I’d wait for my boy at sea,
Golden curls and a smile for me,
But empty pockets and hungry nights,
Make a girl think twice.

Chorus
Cause the fields are wide,
And the cows are fat,
The kitchen shines,
And the money stacks.
Dreams don’t buy no shoes or bread —
Maybe better rich than dead.

Outro
Maybe better rich...
Than dead.
