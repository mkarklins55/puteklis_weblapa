[Verse 1]
Rust on the rails and grass in the ties,
Bicycles hum where the engine cried.
The old tracks stretch like faded veins,
Through whispering fields and gentle rain.

[Chorus]
Green tracks and empty stations,
Dreams that rode on iron wings.
Now the trees are the only passengers,
And the wind is the song it sings.
Green tracks and empty stations,
Ghosts of steam in the summer light.

[Verse 2]
The station walls are cracked and gray,
Timetables crumble into clay.
Children laugh where porters ran,
Through hollow halls where silence stands.

[Chorus]
Green tracks and empty stations,
Dreams that rode on iron wings.
Now the trees are the only passengers,
And the wind is the song it sings.
Green tracks and empty stations,
Ghosts of steam in the summer light.

[Bridge]
Wheels once screamed through the falling dusk,
Now it's soft grass and the riverâ€™s musk.
We ride the paths where the trains once flew,
Through golden fields kissed by dew.

[Outro]
Green tracks, green tracks,
Carrying dreams we never knew.
Empty stations, green tracks,
Carrying dreams we never knew...
